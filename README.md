<h1>Feed Dah Monkey</h1>
<h2>This programme is part of a bigger project.</h2>
<p>There are a number of issues this code base solves:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Making a responsive background image that always has an aspect-ratio of 2:1 regardless of the screen dimensions</li>
  <li>Being able to drag images onto the background and place them on the background so that they keep their position even when resizing the screen</li>
  <li>Adding new images to the DOM without having to loop through existing images</li>
  <li>Effectively removing images from the DOM</li>
  <li>Keeping images fixed within the bounds of the background when dragging</li>
  <li>Making the dragged banana image aware of the monkey's position when being dragged</li>
  <li>And a couple of other little things...</li>
</ol>
